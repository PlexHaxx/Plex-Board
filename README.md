# Plex-Board
## Version 0.1

What is Plex-Board? Put simply, it is a dynamic dashboard for checking the status of multiple services related to Plex Media Server (Plex, Couchpotato, Sickrage, Deluge, Sabnzbd+, etc.).

This is essentially a revamp of a cool project ([Network-Status-Page](https://github.com/scytherswings/Network-Status-Page)) I forked a little while ago.

Pronounced "Plex Dashboard" like that ghetto name [La-a][] (La Dash A)... sorry...

[La-a]: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=la-a

Here are a few screenshots of v0.1
