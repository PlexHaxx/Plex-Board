# Plex-Board
A dynamic dashboard for checking the status of multiple services related to Plex Media Server (Plex, Couchpotato, Sickrage, Deluge, Sabnzbd+, etc.). 

This is essentially a revamp of a cool project ([Network-Status-Page](https://github.com/scytherswings/Network-Status-Page)) I forked a little while ago.

Pronounced "Plex Dashboard" like that ghetto name [La-a][] (La Dash A)... sorry... 

[La-a]: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=la-a

Here's a REALLY rough mockup of what I'm going for... I think...
