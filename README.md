# Plex-Board
## Version 0.1

What is Plex-Board? Put simply, it is a dynamic dashboard for checking the status of multiple services related to Plex Media Server (Plex, Couchpotato, Sickrage, Deluge, Sabnzbd+, etc.).

This is essentially a revamp of a cool project ([Network-Status-Page](https://github.com/scytherswings/Network-Status-Page)) I forked a little while ago.

Pronounced "Plex Dashboard" like that ghetto name [La-a][] (La Dash A)... sorry...

Just for clarificaiton, yes this is _another_ Plex dashboard, but this project is _different_ and I'll tell you why...

PlexWatchWeb and the newer(and very cool) PlexPy projects are oriented more towards statistics etc.
Plex-Board is meant to help the users **and** administrators of a Plex server get a quick overview on the status of the various services related to and including Plex itself.
Eventually I intend to support a unified search that will allow users to request media to be added which could then go to an approval page, or be allowed by default.
